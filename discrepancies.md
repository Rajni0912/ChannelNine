## Not a discrepancy, just an observation
As part of testing this, I observed that when a user is redirected to companies listing page or company information page,the only option to go straight back to same "Companies in the News" section is to click the back button.I would like to discuss if this is a part of design.
Another option to come to this section is to first go to the Companies and then navigate down.
